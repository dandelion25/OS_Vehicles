	<description>To the average spacer, the outlanders of the Rim may appear backwards and isolated; this is hardly the case. Survival on the frontier is no simple feat, and while they may have largely forgotten their origins, they are no less sophisticated for it - outlander technology must contend with a diverse array of threats, ranging from ravaging swarms of insects and tribals to impermeable mechanoid bastions. From the merely exotic to the truly bizzare, the unique cultural and material circumstances of the Rim have driven the creation of vehicular systems unseen elsewhere in the galaxy.</description>
